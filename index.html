								<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>I'm Alireza, a dynamic software engineer fueled by a fervent passion for unraveling the intricacies of technology and physics.</p>
<p>In my perspective, every individual harbors a unique ability that, when harnessed, has the potential to elevate not only personal well-being but also contribute meaningfully to the broader world. This philosophy propels me to dedicate myself tirelessly each day, aspiring to shape a better world through my work.</p>
<p>At the core of my approach is the belief in amalgamating distinct strengths, constructing innovative solutions, and cultivating meaningful change from the ground up.</p>
<p>Beyond the rigors of coding and problem-solving, my time is immersed in the cutting-edge realms of technology, devouring the latest software engineering literature and exploring insightful articles on physics. This intellectual pursuit is complemented by long walks that serve as a canvas for organizing my thoughts, and a deliberate escape to the world of video games for relaxation and inspiration.</p>
<p>A perpetual reminder for me is the acknowledgment that each accomplishment is merely a stepping stone, compelling me to strive relentlessly for greater heights.</p>
<p>In the realm of communication, I prioritize the art of active listening, recognizing its pivotal role in gaining valuable insights before contributing to the discourse.</p>
<p>Guided by a philosophy of embracing positivity, I am committed to leaving behind the weight of negative memories, creating a path for a happier and more fulfilling professional and personal life.</p>
<p>I am Alireza, a software engineer on an unwavering quest for knowledge, innovation, and personal growth, driven by a desire to make a significant impact on the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering.<!-- 								<p>Hi, </p>
								<p>I am Alireza, a software engineer who loves to read and learn more about technology and physics.</p>
								<p>I think we all have some unique ability that we can take advantage of to make a better life for ourselves and others. This mentality has made me work harder and harder every day to have an effect on the world and make a better place out of it.</p>
								<h4>I guess the key is to put our unique strength together and build it from scratch.</h4>
								<h3>After work:</h3>
								<p>I spend most of my time reading about new technologies and software engineering books  and also new articles in physics. I also have keen interest in long walks and organizing my thoughts. 
									Beside these I try to set some time to play video games.</p>
								<h3>I try to remember</h3>
								<p>I try to alway remember that I have done nothing yet and need to try harder to achieve better places.</p>
								<p>I try to listen more and more and gain information before I start talking.</p>
								<p>Leave behind my bad memories which makes life happier.</p> -->

								<h2 class="major">Working Experience</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/workflow.jpg" alt="workflow " /></span>
								<p>As a software engineer I have gone through lots of obstacles to gain more knowledge and am still trying to do so.</p>
								<p>My journey began at university where I joined with different teams to develop new softwares. In university I developed JWEF(Java Web Elements Framework) and also a Prescription platform that Managed prescriptions written by doctors for specific patients only by national Id.After gaining some knowledge in these projects I decided to join Taraz Samaneh to be involved in the enterprise environment.</p>
								<p>Taraz Samaneh owns an ERP System which they decided to make it multi platform. As a software engineer I was responsible for Analysis, Develop, Test, Deployment of the System.</p>
								<p>After over 2 and half years I joined Tamin Insurance a which is the largest Insurance company in Iran. In Tamin I was involved with the Health software department and contributed to admin and hospital panels.Taminâ€™s environment unfortunately was not what I was comfortable with so I moved on and joined Kilid which was a startup company in the real estate area.</p>
								<p>Kilid is considered to be one of the best real estate companies in Iran. In kilid I was Lead developer in the drive squad which developed new features and supported the previous one in the CRM platform of kilid.</p>
