								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<p>Hi, </p>
								<p>I am Alireza, a software engineer who loves to read and learn more about technology and physics.</p>
								<p>I think we all have some unique ability that we can take advantage of to make a better life for ourselves and others. This mentality has made me work harder and harder every day to have an effect on the world and make a better place out of it.</p>
								<h4>I guess the key is to put our unique strength together and build it from scratch.</h4>
								<h3>After work:</h3>
								<p>I spend most of my time reading about new technologies and software engineering books  and also new articles in physics. I also have keen interest in long walks and organizing my thoughts. 
									Beside these I try to set some time to play video games.</p>
								<h3>I try to remember</h3>
								<p>I try to alway remember that I have done nothing yet and need to try harder to achieve better places.</p>
								<p>I try to listen more and more and gain information before I start talking.</p>
								<p>Leave behind my bad memories which makes life happier.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/workflow.jpg" alt="workflow " /></span>
								<p>As a software engineer I have gone through lots of obstacles to gain more knowledge and am still trying to do so.</p>
								<p>My journey began at university where I joined with different teams to develop new softwares. In university I developed JWEF(Java Web Elements Framework) and also a Prescription platform that Managed prescriptions written by doctors for specific patients only by national Id.After gaining some knowledge in these projects I decided to join Taraz Samaneh to be involved in the enterprise environment.</p>
								<p>Taraz Samaneh owns an ERP System which they decided to make it multi platform. As a software engineer I was responsible for Analysis, Develop, Test, Deployment of the System.</p>
								<p>After over 2 and half years I joined Tamin Insurance a which is the largest Insurance company in Iran. In Tamin I was involved with the Health software department and contributed to admin and hospital panels.Taminâ€™s environment unfortunately was not what I was comfortable with so I moved on and joined Kilid which was a startup company in the real estate area.</p>
								<p>Kilid is considered to be one of the best real estate companies in Iran. In kilid I was Lead developer in the drive squad which developed new features and supported the previous one in the CRM platform of kilid.</p>
